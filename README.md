# Unity shader to add the wetness/dryness to the texture
## About🤔
This project is my implementation of the method proposed at [[Sawayama et al. jounal of vision 2017]](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2627514).  

In this paper, they described that the perceptual wetness was related to saturation and lightness of the observed texture. 
They also proposed the image conversion to manipulate our wetness perception.

I have implemented their method as Unity shader for games or media arts.  

Please use the shader freely👍

## Wet Shader☔

The left-side textures were added wetness from right-sides.

## Dry Shader🏜️
